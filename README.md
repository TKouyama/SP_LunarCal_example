# SP_LunarCal_example
Example code to read SP map model.

- example_of_read_sp_model.pro

Evaluating Moon surface radiance at a specified observation geometry based on map version of SP model.
The code will output radiance map (W/m2/sr/um) with tiff format as an example, and quick look of maps of incident, emission, and phase angles and some other information.

- 'avg_cube_1000s-7000s_selected_ip110225.img' :: Binary data, Double-precision float
SP model cube data (lon, lat, wavelength)
0.5x0.5 degree grid interval in longitude and latitude direction, and there are 160 channels in wavelength.
i.e. (lon, lat, wavelength) = (720, 360, 160)

  ;; Note: Definition of SP map coordinate  (Lon, Lat)
  ;; (0.25, 89.75), (0.75, 89.75), ... (359.75,89.75) ;; North pole

- 'albedo_group_05x05.dat' :: Binary data, 2byte Integer
 (lon, lat) = (720, 360)
Albedo group map (this file is made by Kouyama based on Yokota's definition in Yokota et al 2011)
Note; Latitude direction may be opposit to the SP model definition, sorry..
